**Title:** Metro System (MERN Stack)

**Description:**

* This project provides a web-based metro system application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
* Users can view metro maps, search for routes, and get real-time updates on train schedules and delays.

**Features:**

* **Interactive Metro Maps:**
    * Display detailed maps of the metro network with stations, lines, and connections.
    * Allow users to zoom in and out, pan, and search for specific stations.
* **Route Planning:**
    * Enable users to input their starting and destination stations.
    * Provide optimal routes with the shortest travel time or fewest transfers.
    * Display step-by-step directions, including transfer information and estimated travel duration.
* **Real-time Updates:**
    * Integrate with a real-time data source (e.g., API, web socket) to fetch current train schedules and delays.
    * Display this information on the map and in route planning results.
* **User Authentication:**
    * Implement user registration and login functionalities.
    * Allow users to save their favorite routes and preferences.

**Technologies:**

* **Frontend:**
    * React
* **Backend:**
    * Node.js
    * MongoDB
* **API:**
    *  Implement a RESTful API to handle data requests and responses.

**Usage:**

    * Click on different stations or lines to view their details.
    * Use the zoom and pan controls to navigate the map.
* **Plan Routes:**
    * Enter your starting and destination stations.
    * Choose your preferred route option (shortest time, fewest transfers).
    * View the route details and estimated travel time.
* **Check Real-time Updates:**
